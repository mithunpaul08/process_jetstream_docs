# process_jetstream_docs
Take the 144 .md files in jetstream repo and extract glossary out of it using an AI model

Uses a core divide and conquer approach. 
Note: Core of the code was written in couple of hours, - But Works. Also in combination to this, I used tools like sed, awk, regex on sublime text, and even chatgpt at times to do various cleaning up + sub parts- especially the nasty irritating ones like alphabetic merge sorting and cleaning up replies from the AI model. Basically my philosophy is use whatever it takes/whatever tools are available out there, as long as you get shit done.
